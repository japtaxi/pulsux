</p><h1>Cheapie N15 Pulsux SSSux mods</h1>
<p>

This all started out from borrowing my aunty's brand new 1999 N15 Pulsar SSS 
during the waiting period of engine transplant process in R32 Skyline.
</p><p>
During these time the Pulsar had been driven hard everday, and has shown 
very clearly the car's performance is some what crippled and definitely slow 
in terms of acceleration and top speed (mainly due to automatic gearbox and 
gear ratio).  
</p><p>
This motivated the idea of applying some simple mods to the car, in hope of
gaining some more minor performance if possible with the least amount of 
money spent.
</p><p>
Below are some of the simple mods already performed to the Pulsar. 
These might not be of any interests to serious car enthusiasts nor 
would it results big power gain.  The goal here is spend the least amount and 
DIY as much as possible.  Of course there are some other mod projects that 
just not yet planned or started. (I have returned the Pulsar back to my aunty,
this means no more mods will be planned as of November, 2000)
</p><p>
Enjoy a good laugh at these pages.  If you happen to (unfortunately) own 
one of these and still remained unmodified, you can consider try out some of 
these mods your self at your own risk.
